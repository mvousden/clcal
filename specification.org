* Calendars
  Calendars are a collection of 'things' that have a time component. These can
  be events that happen once or many times regularly predictably or
  unpredictably, deadlines by which something must be complete, or plans for
  when work is to be started in future, optionally in response to a certain
  event being completed, or in preparation of a deadline.

  Calendars are stored using YAML.

* Loading calendars
  By default, no calendar is defined. The default calendar is loaded from the
  ~/.clcal configuration file, if it exists.
* Commands
** Concerning files
   - 'target $PATH' sets the value for the path in the configuration file.
   - 'event "Dentist" at 12:30 2017-05-03' creates an event with the name
     "Dentist" at that time.
** Concerning events
*** Examples
    - 'event "Dentist" note "Don't forget to buy floss!"' adds a note to the
      event with the name "Dentist". Events can have many notes.
    - 'event "Party" at 21:40 2018-06-06 note "Graham's House"' combines these
      commands.
    - 'event "Dentist" at 12:30 2017-11-03' creates another Dentist event at
      that time.
    - 'event "Party" move 22:00' changes the start time of the party event.
    - 'event "Dentist" move 2017-11-04' prompts asks the user which event to
      move.
    - 'event "Party" every 7d' turns the Party event into a repeating event,
      which happens every 7 days.
    - 'event "Party" skip' skips the next party event instance.
    - 'event "Party" unskip' cancels the latest skip.
    - 'event "Party" note "Somewhere else" then only applies to the upcoming
      instance.
    - 'event "Party" INSTANCE-UUID note "Somewhere else" applies the note to a
      specific instance.
    - 'event "Party" INSTANCE-UUID note-all "No drinking!" applies the note to
      the entire repeating event.
    - 'event "Party" note-del NOTE-UUID deletes the note for a given instance,
      or for the entire event.
    - 'event "Dentist" done' marks the event as done.
    - 'event "Party" delete' deletes the Party event entirely (for if it was
      created by mistake).
*** Syntax rules
    - 'event $NAME action $PROPERTY' is the general syntax.
    - Events are referred to by name, but are stored with UUIDs that can be
      used instead. The user can find these by viewing the calendar.
    - If there are multiple events with the same name, the user is asked which
      event to apply the action to.
** Concerning viewing
*** Examples
    - 'view' shows the calendar for today, including complete items.
    - 'view X' shows the calendar for the next X days.
